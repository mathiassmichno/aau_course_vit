\subsection{Case A}
\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
    \item[What should Alyssa do?] \hfill\\
        Alyssa should not put Ben as co-author, since he has not done any of the work. She should seek funding, and it that is not possible, she should withdraw the paper from the conference.
    \item[How should Ben have handled the situation?] \hfill\\
        He should have commented on the drafts and addressed the problem from the start, rather than hiding it and being shy of conflict.
    \item[Is it reasonable to have expected Alyssa to have behaved any differently?] \hfill\\
        If we think ethically, no, she would not have behaved any differently. But if you look at it from a job perspective, she could have chosen differently because of the risk she takes, if she gets into a rift with the professor.
\end{description}
\subsection{Case B}
\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
    \item[Do you see any cases of irresponsible conduct?] \hfill\\
        It is irresponsible conduct of Anna to put Bob as co-author and of Bob to let her do it. It is also irresponsible conduct of Bob to put the paper in his PhD thesis, making it plagiarism.
    \item[If so, what would have been the appropriate responsible conduct?] \hfill\\
Anna should have gone to the professor with her draft and talked to him, what options she had, both including and excluding Bob.
    \item[What actions should be taken in the present situation, if any?] \hfill\\
It is not really possible to take actions, that could prove that they are guilty, without hitting innocent people.
\end{description}
\subsection{Case C}
\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
    \item[If the experiments are part of a series, are Paula and her students justified in not publishing them together?] \hfill\\
        If you decide to not publish them together, you have to make sure, that the papers do not become too simple. There is a danger of repetition if the experiments are split up and a danger of no new material.
    \item[If they decide to publish a single paper, how should the listing of authors be handled?] \hfill\\
Alphabetical order.
    \item[If a single paper is published, how can they emphasize to the review committees and funding agencies their various roles and the importance of the paper?] \hfill\\
This should not be necessary, but it can be done in the preface.
\end{description}
\subsection{Case D}
\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
    \item[How should the data from the two suspected runs be handled?] \hfill\\
Present and discuss why they are different.
    \item[Should the data be included in tests of the statistical significance and why?] \hfill\\
You could argue that they should not be included because of the fluctuations.
    \item[What other sources of information, in addition to their faculty adviser, can Deborah and Kathleen use to help decide?] \hfill\\
Contact laboratory workers and other professors.
\end{description}

\section{Plenary Session}
After discussing the cases in plenum I did not change opinion.
However I did become aware of other ways to present authors than alphabetical, e.g.\ divided into groups.
